üìù To-Do App with useRef
This is a simple To-Do application built using React. Initially, the app was built using only the useState hook for managing state, but it has now been refactored to use the useRef hook for certain operations, enhancing the performance and behavior of the app.

 Why we use Ref?
1. Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders
2. Accessing DOM Elements
Ref provides a way to directly reference and manipulate DOM elements. State is not suitable for this purpose.

Example: Using ref to focus on an input element programmatically.

3. Storing Mutable Values Without Re-renders
Ref is ideal for storing values that do not affect the UI but need to persist across renders. State is meant for values that impact the UI.

Example: Keeping track of a previous value or a mutable counter that doesn‚Äôt need to trigger re-renders.
